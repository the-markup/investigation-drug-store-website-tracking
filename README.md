# Pixel Hunt: Drug Store Website Tracking

This repository contains screenshots and HAR files supporting our article "[TKTK](https://themarkup.org/TKTK)". This article was coreported with KFF Health News and is available on [its site](TKTK) as well.

In the `data` folder there is a subfolder for each company we examined. Inside each folder are screenshots of relevant data being sent to tech companies, and [HAR files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) saved during the process of documenting the data collection.
